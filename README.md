<h1>Abstract</h1>
Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple and fun game played by two players using O’s and X’s. It consists of 9 slots separated by lines. The purpose of the game is to get 3 consecutive O’s or X’s in a line, diagonal or straight. Whoever achieves this goal first, wins.
We have created a Tic-Tac-Toe Game Program in Dev C++ using C Programming Language. It is played by one user and the computer. We have integrated algorithms to enable the computer to play tactically and win if the user makes a wrong move. We have set up a login system where users can register an account, play the game, track their scores, and log in any time they want. For this purpose, we have made use of a database by utilizing file handling and data entry. 
The purpose of this program is to enable the user to play a competitive, convenient, and fun game of Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.
<h1>Functionality</h1>
